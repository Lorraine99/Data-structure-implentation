The goal of this project is to write a C++ implementation for a Quadtree that stores informations related to cities based on their latitudes and longitudes. Each node of the tree holds information such as population, cost of living, and average net salary. 
It performs operations like:
1. Insert a node.
2. Find max,min or total value for  a city infomation under coordinate x,y in a given direction.
3. Print the tree in inorder traversal
4. Destory the whole tree
5. Count the size of the tree.
